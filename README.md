Where was I
===========


A simple bookmark manager written in in ruby. A first introduction to databases using datamapper and postgres. Also took my first steps in intergration testing using cucumber.

####The app involved using many new concepts and skills including:

> *	 persisting users and bookmarks in the database.
> *  One to many relationships between users and bookmars. 
> *  Many to many relationships tags.  
> *  User authentication and tracking with Bcrypt and sessions
